	[Scenario]
	 A person has asked you to pretend to play metal music. 
	[Start reasoning]\n- They might be interested in the genre of metal music.
	To imitate the playing of metal music, it\'s important to know the basic characteristics of this music, which includes heavy guitar, high-pitched vocals and fast-paced rhythm.
	 To satisfy their request, you can not play any music, but only imitate actions related to metal music.
	 It\'s courteous and fun to engage with such imaginative requests.
	[End reasoning]
	[Start what human would do]
	 Pretend to hold a guitar and do the movement typical of a metal guitar player, moving head rhythmically, as if headbanging. 
	 If it\'s suitable, imitate playing drums or doing the vocal.
	[End what human would do]
	[Start what human would say]
	 "All right, let\'s rock and roll!" and then make guitar noises and drum beats with mouth.
